                    At my university, the schedule is a mess. We would be given images with the schedule
                    for all the courses, and we would have to manually search & match the courses we
                    wanted to take.
                </p>
                <p class="my-2">
                    So I made a website where you could see which courses overlap, their professors,
                    and the classrooms they were in, in a interactive table.
                </p>
                <p class="my-2">
                    I made the page completely in vanilla JS, all elements & animations were created dynamically
                    using DOM primitives. It was deployed on a free hosting service.

                    Between 2017 & 2019 I became interested in fansubbing anime. I made a website
                    where you could download the subtitles for the anime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website was made in PHP, although most of the pages were static.
                    At the time I didn't know about databases, so I made my own file based database,
                    with a custom format in PHP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned about domain names, A/AAAA/CNAME records, shared hosting &
                    integrating with external services like analytics & disqus.
