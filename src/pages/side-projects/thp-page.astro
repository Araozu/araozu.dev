    This is a static webpage that contains documentation
    for the THP programming language.
    <br />
    <br />
    THP is a strong, statically typed, functional first
    language that compiles to PHP.
    <br>
    <br>
    The page is written with Astro, and connects to the
    compiler to provide syntax highlighting, error
    detection, reference resolving and automatic
    documentation generation.
