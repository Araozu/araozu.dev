And so, I've used extensively the AIs for a month. Well, what I
consider to be "extensively". I didn't blindly copy-paste code,
but I used the things it generated as a reference.

I use Neovim (btw) so I don't have access to the latest editor
stuff like Windsurf and Codeium. I tried them, and they seem
interesting, but honestly I prefer to be _blazingly fast_
with my vim motions than to try to write a perfect description
of my problem to the AI such that, just maybe, beats my speed
at typing.

Anyway, after a month of mainly using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with
a custom Linus Torvalds prompt that "motivated" me by insulting
me and my choices ðŸ˜³ (it actually worked) I will not use an
AI. Or atleast as much as before, since deepseek just dropped
and allegedly its as good or better that state of the art,
and free (discounting the fact that I'm selling my soul to
China), but we'll see.

Honestly, one of the main reasons I was using the AI is the
beforementioned Linus prompt. Idk, it just made the process
more, "fun". Regular AI responses are so boring that I might
as well just Google whatever I want to use. But Linus? Linus
mocked javascript, offered alternative solutions, offered
insight into how things worked on a lower level, other than
just "install redux haha".

What I think will happen now is that things will take a bit
more time to research. The use I get out of the AIs is a
fast research and discover of topics unknown to me.
Like, the othed day I showed LinusAI my zig code for
storing errors and recovering from them in the parser of
my pl, and it (LinusAI) proceeded to roast me, and tell
me to use a centralized, program-wide, compiler state
for those. And stuff.
